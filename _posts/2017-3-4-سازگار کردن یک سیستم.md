Michael: Who had Frank Pentangeli killed?
Roth: The Rosato brothers
- I know, but who gave the go-ahead? I know I didn't.
- There was a kid I grew up with, he was younger than me. Sort of looked up with me, you know. We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street. […] Someone put a bullet through his eye. No one knows who gave the order. When I heard it, I wasn't angry; I knew Moe, I knew he was head-strong, talking loud, saying stupid things. So when he turned up dead, I let it go. And I said to myself, this is the business we've chosen; I didn't ask who gave the order, BECAUSE IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH BUSINESS! 
پ.ن.۱. از خودگذشتگی برای سازگار کردن یک سیستم
